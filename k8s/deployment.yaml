## Kubernetes Deployment for the practice Helidon SE application
# Provides a replicated (2 pods) stateless service exposing port 8080 with
# liveness/readiness probes, resource requests/limits, and a ServiceAccount
# (defined in rbac.yaml) for future RBAC-controlled operations (e.g., managing Jobs).
# Apply after building the image locally (docker build -t practice-app:1.0.0 .)
# and creating the associated RBAC resources.
